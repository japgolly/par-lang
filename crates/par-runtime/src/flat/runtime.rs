//! This is the V2 runtime for the Par language
//!
//! Unlike with the old runtime, program state is strictly separated with
//! immutable global program code. The global nodes are stored in an [`Arena`].
//! Global nodes are attached to a piece of state which is a pointer to its [`Instance`]
//!
//! An `Instance` is an array of variable slots; which might be either empty or filled with a [`Value`]
//! Instances are used to store program state within each global package, and also
//! for communication within each global packages.
//!
//! Global nodes are all stored contiguously, and a definition's state is usually within the same Instance, which means
//! that the runtime enjoys cache locality.
//!
//! Additionally, state can be stored in either [`Shared`] nodes or [`Linear`] nodes.
//!
//! `Linear` nodes are temporarily created by readback to interact with the program. They are usually stored in `Box`es
//!  Additionally, ShareHoles are a type of linear value which is created when attempting to duplicate a global variable.
//!  It is roughly the dual of a fanout node.
//!
//! `Shared` nodes are created when a node is duplicated. They are reference-counted and thus, copying them is cheap. They are destroyed
//! by interacting them with a Global node that destructures values, such as a Par node or a Choice node. This destructures the shared node,
//! but the children will still be reference-counted. This allows cheap copying of runtime values, which is something the old
//! runtime was not able to do.
//!
//! The runtime is handled by the [`Runtime`] struct. It tracks the program's redexes, which
//! are pairs of nodes that interact with each other, and reduces them until the program is finished.
//! The `Runtime` does not know what to do with IO operations; that is handled by the `Reducer`

        //
        // (4) Expanding packages with FanBehavior::Expand (box-like packages)
        //
        // This happens when the box interacts with Request, ExtFns, ExtArcs, and GlobalContinuations (and Values)
        // Since none of these are duplications, the only way to progress is to expand the box (dereliction)
        // and expose the inner value.
        //
        // (5) External calls: Requests, ExtFns and ExtArcs
        //

        // the nodes that are currently of a higher priority.
